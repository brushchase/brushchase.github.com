    <p>After nearly four years, countless hours of meetings and deliberations, and some
      pushback from community activist groups, Bushwick officials and residents unveiled
      a long-awaited plan on Saturday to shore up the neighborhood against the effects of
      gentrification and development in the coming years.</p>
    <p>Dubbed the Bushwick Community Plan (BCP), the collaborative framework
       contains strategies for addressing a host of issues affecting the
       rapidly-gentrifying neighborhood, from zoning and land use to economic development
       and transportation. It takes specific aim at the latter categories, proposing a
       downzoning across most of the district and an increase in affordable housing stock
        in a bid to moderate future growth and preserving the neighborhood’s existing
         character.</p>
    <p>“The plan that I want to push is the plan that comes out of this,” Councilman
       Antonio Reynoso, who represents Bushwick as well as parts of Williamsburg, told
       residents at a release event yesterday. “Not a plan that comes from the
       administration, not a plan that comes from [the Department of City Planning].
       I want to make sure that we follow through on every aspect of this plan from the
       community. I want this to be the first community plan in the city of New York
       that’s done word-for-word.”</p>
    <p>Details of the plan were presented in full at the town hall at Bushwick High School,
       where Reynoso and other stakeholders heralded it as one of the strongest examples
       of a community-based rezoning initiative in New York. Though other neighborhoods
        -- such as East New York in 2015 and East Harlem in 2016 --  have relied on
        community input in their rezoning efforts in recent years, few have seen
        engagement as comprehensive as Bushwick’s, they said, which brought together a
        whole range of community stakeholders, including local civic groups, elected
        officials, and residents themselves.</p>
    <p>“This plan is really different than any rezoning plans that have been put forward
       before,” said Alex Fennell, the Network Director for the nonprofit Churches United
        For Fair Housing. “All of the previous rezonings, there was some public comment
        and some community engagement, but what makes Bushwick unique is that the community
         was engaged since day one and actually started the process. This is not a
         situation where the city is presenting us with a plan and we kind of take it or
          leave it.”</p>

    <p>Bushwick’s own initiative was conceived in 2014, after members of its community
      board asked Reynoso’s and fellow councilman Rafael Espinal’s offices to conduct a
      study of out-of-context development occurring in the district. A predominantly
      working-class neighborhood with a large immigrant population, Bushwick has been at
      the forefront of the wider borough’s encroaching gentrification in recent years, with
       rents having increased 35 percent since 2010. Over half of households are burdened
        by high housing costs, meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on
        rent, and only a third of residents live in rent-stabilized housing. </p>
    <p>New developments -- 5,000 units since 2008, officials said -- have sprung up across
      the district to alleviate that burden. But, thanks to a uniform zoning designation
      left in place since 1961, they’ve been built with little regard to size and without
      the kind of affordability guarantees intended to protect longtime and low-income
       residents from displacement, critics argue. </p>
    <p>Officials and residents met at over a dozens meetings in the last few years to
      address those conditions, including at community-wide town halls and zoning workshops.
       Subcommittees were formed by the community board to formulate priorities on specific
        issues, such as transportation and open space. A steering committee to oversee the
         process was also convened, featuring representatives from a number of local
         organizations and nonprofits, like Make The Road New York, Riseboro Community
         Partnership, and the North Brooklyn Coalition. </p>
    <p>The resulting plan puts forth a number of changes aimed improving residents’
        overall quality of life in the district. Some are targeted, such as lighting
        improvements in parks and increased sanitation funding for major thoroughfares,
        the institution a flipping fee on speculators and creating a tax credit program
        for landlords of small homes, or the establishment of historic corridors along
        streets like Bushwick Avenue.</p>
        <h2 id="pullquote">“The city gave us their plan,
           it didn’t work, so we created our own.”</h2>
    <p>Others, however, are more sweeping. Among the plan’s more significant proposals
        is a rezoning of major parts of the district, including a downzoning of many
        residential sidestreets from the current R6 designation and a higher density
        upzoning of major transit corridors like Myrtle and Wyckoff. Such changes would
        impose height and scale regulations on new developments, which officials said would
        prevent the kind of out-of-character buildings that have arisen in recent years. </p>
    <p>On housing, the plan also calls for a larger percentage of affordable units be
        built than required under the city’s mandatory inclusionary housing program,
         using public financing and tax credits to further incentivize developers.
         Framers said that would help ensure the neighborhood remains affordable to
         current residents even as development continues.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to created a scenario where no more units would be built than under a
        no-action scenario,” said Scott Short, chief executive officer at Risboro, who
        noted that as many as 7,000 market-rate housing units could result from Bushwick’s
         current zoning in the next year. “However, a significant portion of the units
         that would get built would need to be affordable.”</p>
    <p>Residents and officials touted these measures and more at Saturday’s town hall,
        saying that they promised to inject the community’s voice into the city’s zoning
         deliberations. Framers of the BCP have criticized the Department of City Planning’s
          own plans for the district, arguing that they fail to take into account
          community-specific concerns, such as a commitment to deeply affordable housing
          and the preservation of Bushwick’s existing manufacturing spaces, half of which
          the city has sought to convert to residential housing. </p>
    <p>They said the next step is to take the plan to the DCP, though it’s
      unclear how many of its
      proposals will be accepted.</p>
    <p>“The city gave us their plan, it didn’t work, so we created our own,”
      said Robert Camacho, a longtime Bushwick resident who was recently elected
      chairman of Community Board 4. “And we got more affordable housing, more stuff.
      So we actually did the city’s job. Just do what we tell you to do, and keep the
      people here that fought to be here when nobody wanted to be here.”</p>
