    <p>Julia Salazar may have <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/09/julia-salazar-has-won-her-primary-against-dilan-in-new-york.html">handily defeated</a> longtime incumbent state Senator Martin Dilan in September’s Democratic primary in the 18th district, but new data analysis suggests she probably couldn't have done it without the help of one major trend that has greatly shaped the area in recent years: gentrification.</p>
    <p>According to election results information from the <a href="http://vote.nyc.ny.us/html/results/results.shtml">NYC Board of Elections</a>, Salazar won 58 to Martin’s 41 percent of votes across the district. But she performed especially well in the district’s northern end, where neighborhoods experiencing rapid gentrification came out in force for the self-described democratic socialist.</p>
    <p>In election precincts comprising neighborhoods like Greenpoint and Williamsburg, Salazar captured up to 95 percent of the vote against Dilan. Both neighborhoods have been <a href="https://www.amny.com/real-estate/williamsburg-leads-nyc-in-gentrification-report-says-1.11786129">at the forefront</a> of the waves of new development that have swept across north Brooklyn in recent years, forcing median rents to skyrocket and reshaping its demographic makeup.</p>

    <p>By contrast, Salazar was less successful in neighborhoods to the east, such as Cypress Hills and Highland Park. In addition to being political strongholds for Dilan, those neighborhoods have experienced comparatively less gentrification than their northwestern counterparts, with the population remaining more uniformly black and Hispanic.</p>
    <p>“What the map shows is where the votes came from versus the incumbent,” said Steven Romalewski, a researcher at the <a href="https://gc.cuny.edu/CUR">Center for Urban Research</a> at the City University of New York Graduate Center. “It doesn’t show anything about who voted.”</p>
    <p>“But based on the characteristics of the area, you can surmise what kind of voters might have been behind those votes,” he added.</p>
    <p>The results aren’t unlike those of another high-profile New York primary race this year: the 14th congressional district contest between Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley. In July, the progressive firebrand shocked political experts and pundits when she defeated Crowley to become the youngest woman to serve in congress in U.S. history.</p>
    <p>But election results data following that race suggested Ocasio-Cortez also benefited significantly from parts of her district experiencing gentrification. Specifically, high voter turnout in Queens -- where neighborhoods like Astoria have seen average rents jump <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160511/astoria/astoria-is-only-queens-neighborhood-considered-gentrifying-study-says/">26.7 percent between 2010 and 2014</a> -- helped propel her to victory. </p>
