  <p>Chase is a hopeless itinerant and adventure junkie who occasionally moonlights as a multimedia journalist. He has explored the U.S. by van, motorcycle, and freight train, backpacked throughout China and southeast Asia, worked as a bike messenger and a Christmas tree salesman in New York City, reported on politics and public policy in New Jersey and Brooklyn, and most recently spent a summer in Nepal, writing for the The Kathmandu Post. Chase obtained a master's degree from the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY in 2019, and is currently serving as an assistant editor at American Heritage, as part of a fellowship with the Poynter Institute. See more of his work here.

    You can also find him on Twitter, Muck Rack, and LinkedIn, among other places.</p>
